# Deployment 
This websquizite was created using visual studio which us an integrated development environment from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. I have made it live using Git pages. To do this I initiated the git repository with 'git innit', then used 'git status' to see which of my un-tracked files had not been added to the new repository. I used 'git commit -m "added in a specific message" to commit my changed files to the repository. Once my files were committed I used 'git push' to push all my new and changed files to GitHub before making it live with Git pages. I did this every time I made major changes to any part of my site.
